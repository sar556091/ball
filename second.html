  <p>The Lord of the Rings is an epic  high fantasy novel by the English <br> author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. Set in Middle-earth, the story began <br> as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 children's book The Hobbit, but eventually <br> developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings <br> is one of the best-selling books ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.

    The title <br> refers to the story's main antagonist  Sauron, the Dark Lord who in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power given <br>  to Men, Dwarves, and Elves, in his campaign to conquer all of Middle-earth. From homely beginnings <br> in the Shire, a hobbit land reminiscent of the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the quest to destroy the One Ring, seen mainly through the eyes of the hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin. Aiding Frodo are the Wizard Gandalf, the Men Aragorn and Boromir, the Elf Legolas, and the Dwarf Gimli, who unite in order to rally the Free Peoples of Middle-earth against Sauron's armies and give Frodo a chance to destroy the One Ring in the fire of Mount Doom.</p>
